## Limitations
- Webhook actions do not work with the TriggerOnLogUpdate trigger as it is restricted by "email-reply" to email actions only.
- If network error, response callback is not called. Seems ok, but is it? => Seen with Erwan, it's ok.
- Google Chat action only works with Google Workspace (paid version)

## Other integration candidates
- Jira webhook
- Jenkins webhook
- Telegram notification
- Mattermott notification
- GitHub
