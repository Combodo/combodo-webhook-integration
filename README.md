# Generic
- Example of payload callback:
    - Make a snippet like:
       ```
       class WebhookPayloadHandler
        {
            public static function MyPayloadPreparation($oObject, $aContextArgs, $oLog, $oAction)
            {
                $aData = array(
                    'title' => $oObject->GetName(),
                    'description' => 'The object was updated',
                );
        
                return json_encode($aData);
            }
        }
        ```
    - Put it in the "Prepare payload callback" attribute: `\WebhookPayloadHandler::MyPayloadPreparation`
