# iTop module: Webhooks integration

## About

Upon the occurrence of an event in iTop (e.g. creation of an object), iTop webhooks will make a HTTP(S) request to the configured URL so to invoke behavior on another web application.


## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss additional modules.


## About Us
